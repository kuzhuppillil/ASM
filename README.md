## Project 1: Smart Weather using Jira (Agile Scrum Master Project)

In this project, I applied Agile Scrum Master concepts to analyze a hypothetical organization called GTM systems. The project focused on developing a SmartWeather system that aggregates weather data from multiple providers and provides meaningful insights for businesses. I created epics, user stories, and tasks in Jira, and followed the Scrum framework to complete a sprint.
